# Game Of Life

I recently attended a Global Day of Coderetreat in Salford. I was part of a delegation from the company
where I work, DRL, which also co-sponsored the event.

The event involved pair programming and TDD. Each of the six pairings throughout the day lasted 45 minutes.
The exercise for the day was Conway's Game of Life.

During the week after the event, I decided to come up with a complete implementation of the exercise including
rendering to the console. This project is the result.

## Seeds

The console program takes a single command line parameter which identifies the seed pattern:

* 1 - [Blinker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_blinker.gif)
* 2 - [Toad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_toad.gif)
* 3 - [Beacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_beacon.gif)
* 4 - [Pulsar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_pulsar.gif)
* 5 - [Glider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_animated_glider.gif)
* 6 - [Lightweight space ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_animated_LWSS.gif)
* 7 - [R-pentomino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_fpento.svg)
* 8 - [Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Game_of_life_glider_gun.svg)

If no parameter is given, the seed defaults to Pulsar.
